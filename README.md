Project Description:
The Library Management System is a C# application developed in Visual Studio. It serves as an interactive interface for managing the operations of a public library. The system has three main roles: Staff, User, and Supplier.

The system's data is stored in an SQLite database, which can be found in the file path: LibraryManagerSystem/LibraryMS/bin/Debug/library.db 
We use SQLiteStudio for managing the database.
